  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 0; margin: 0; font-size: 14px;">Nothing speaks more then a referral. I was referred to MDI by my friend and realtor. My experience with MDI exceeded my expectations! I was in the process of moving into a new home and wanted a number of projects done. The customer service and work speaks for itself! They are professional and committed to getting the job done right. I was constantly well informed about the progress and they were very responsive to my questions/concerns during the whole process. I appreciated them striving to make their customers happy and satisfied.Moving and home projects can be stressful, but MDI did a great and clean job each day! They made it very seamless and comfortable to walk into the home daily during the duration of their work. When all the work was done and I had my walk-thru, I was happy to not just be walking into my new house, but a place I can finally call home. Looking forward to using them in the near future for exterior painting and landscaping. I can't reiterate enough the diligence and commitment this team provided.</p><p style="text-align: right; margin: 10px 15px 0 0; font-weight: bold;">- Raquel Afuang</p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 0; margin: 0; font-size: 14px;">I finally got to go to our  office today, and am now in receipt of your card and chocolates. Just wanted to take some time to you thank you very much for this as I really appreciate it. Your team is indeed an asset to our company. Looking forward to working with you all again in 2011.</p><p style="text-align: right; margin: 10px 15px 0 0; font-weight: bold;">- Josephine Tora</p><br>

  <p style="padding: 10px 0 0 0; margin: 0; font-size: 14px;">I just wanted to say thank you to the whole MDI team. They did such an outstanding job on my house renovation. I called MDI based on a recommendation from a friend. He told me that they did great work and at a reasonable price. My friend was right, the team at MDI did an excellent job, from start to finish, they always showed up on time, were very professional, and answered any questions that I had. Now my house looks great! And it's all thanks to the people at MDI.</p><p style="text-align: right; margin: 10px 15px 0 0; font-weight: bold;">- Jessie Gauger</p><br>
